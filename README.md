Cracks are the precursor of defects. Labeling the cracks is a tedious process. To augment the cracks with similar geometric properties, cracks can be split into tile images. In this program, the thinned cracks are traversed with a certain overlap ratio between the adjacent tiles. This will ensure to produce the cracks with similar attributes. Note that some cracks artifacts may show in the tiled images.
